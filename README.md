* A simple polyhedral/RPG/wargame dice roller with predefined buttons for the common dice types (d4,d6,d8,d10,d12,d20) plus percentile (d100) and Fudge/FATE dice (dF). 
* Change how many dice are rolled by typing in the desired number in the appropriate row "#" column, values are now persisted between uses. 
* Individual die rolls are also displayed in the Dice Pool textbox if you want the separate numbers instead of the sum. 
* Results can be copied and pasted.
* Popup uses light/dark mode depending on OS theme (css @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark))
